        <h2>A Brief Review of Myself</h2>

                 <p>
                  I like to learn new things, build my skills, and solve problems. I have a
                  Masters Degree in Public Administration, a black belt in tae-kwon-do, and
                  enjoy woodoworking. I eat healthy, run daily, and am calm under pressure.
                  I can work independently or in groups and have held leadership positions.
                 </p>
            <h2>Website Overview</h2>
               <p>
                  This is a static website that is written only in HTML and CSS. This displays the progression of my HTML and CSS skills. Each page will demonstrate a different collection of HTML tags
                  that will be styled from one CSS page. There is a README.md file and a planning.md file that contain some basic project information and planning respectively.

                </p>

            <h2>Website Content</h2>

               <p>This is the welcome page, also the page for demonstrating some basic HTML elements with styling.
                The Form page is not a misnomer, it is for showing off... a form. The Education &amp; Experience page demonstrates anchor links, while also tipping my hat to the lovely people who brought many free and useful resources my way. Kudos!
                On the final page there is a set of 3 wireframes examples with my efforts to match them.
