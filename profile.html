            <h2>A Brief Review of Myself</h2>

                 <p>
                  Lifelong learner-examples. Healthy. Smart. Driven. Self-starter.
                  Attitude, problem solver, calm under pressure, skill builder
                 </p>
            <h2>Website Overview</h2>
               <p>
                  This is a static website that displays the progression of my HTML and CSS skills. Each page will demonstrate a different collection of HTML tags
                  that will be styled from one CSS page. There is a README.md file and a planning.md file that contain some basic project information and planning respectively.
              </p>

            <h2>Website Content</h2>

               <p>This is the welcome page, also the page for demonstrating some basic HTML elements with styling.
                The Form page is not a misnomer, it is for showing off a... Form. The Education &amp; Experience page demonstrates anchor links, while also tipping my hat to the lovely people who brought many free and useful resources my way. Kudos!
                Finally, for this 4 page project is the picture page. What better than to show off the work I've done so far than to use a picture page? For the mole game I wrote the CSS code for most of it to make the moles and hill show up in the correct places.
